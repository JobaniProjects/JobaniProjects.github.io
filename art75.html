	   Artist Statement
	</h5>
<br>
	<p>
	   My name is David Zenteno and my artwork incorporates a vibrant, colorful palette and hues to 
	   bring about the emotions of happiness, comfort, and warmth. <br> What I try to bring in my artwork
           is a euphoric experience while integrating psychedelic visuals. My interest in dreams and what
	   visuals they produce helps me <br> explore  ways  to incorporate those traits into my work. I want
	   my art to ease the mind of the viewer and be a therapeutic experience, taking away any stress 
	   in <br> the mind. Everyone has their special place where they get comfort and peace, and I am 
	   recreating that with what I envision. I create my artwork through digital <br> media, using Unity, 
	   HTML, CSS, Photoshop, Premiere, and Illustrator. Artists like Takashi Murakami and Tyler the 
	   Creator influence me to go towards vibrant <br> vivid colors. Aesthetics and the human desire for 
	   togetherness and tranquility inspire me to create artwork that sooths the soul.

	   The video tells a story of how society has become dependent of technology, 
	   especially phones. <br> Sometimes people get caught up on technology that they 
	   miss parts of their life and do not <br> realize it until it is too late. In 
	   this situation, the main character is lucky enough to notice <br> the negative effects 
	   of the  overconsumption of technology. He quickly breaks out the <br> cycle, but sometimes 
	   others are not as fortunate.

	   I want my video installation to be about dreams. When the covid lockdowns began,
	   I started sleeping more and dreaming more. <br> These dreams were intense and mind-bending, 
	   filled with distortion and vivid colors. I think due to the quick lifestyle change <br>
	   because of the lockdown, my dreams were affected. This was my subconscious mind reacting
	   to the stressful situation. <br> With Touch Designer and Premiere, I will alter the video to 
	   produce visuals of the dreams.

	   This AR worlds lets you explore different worlds and dimensions 
	   in a blink of an eye. I want to show how powerful <br> technology has 
	   gotten for us to just experience something extraordinary through 
	   our phones. The robot is there <br> to show you these wonders and it 
	   rushes you to see everything, just like technology is rushing to
	   advance and <br> we are trying to keep up.

	   I decided to make a short scary film about a person walking to the park
	   and also encounters a creature <br> who is out for blood. I filmed the main character
	   walking, running, and tripping around a park <br> with my iphone and I used sounds 
	   from freesounds.org.
