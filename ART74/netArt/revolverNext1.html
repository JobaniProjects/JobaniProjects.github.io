	   Oh no! You're starting to get hungry, but all you have is bullets. You start searching 
	   around for anything edible. To your luck you find two strains of fruit. Careful! You 
	   remember that one of them is deadly, but that's about all the info you retained. 
	   It's all up to luck and faith.

	   <a href="revolverDeath1.html">1.</a> (left) Spongy texture, juicy, and a murkey yellow color; this fruit 
	   reminds you of pineapple. Taking a sniff you catch a citrusy smell combined with cinamon. Doesn't look 
	   poisonous, so why not? (eat)

	   <a href="hungerBeGone.html">2.</a> (right) A big purple berry that oddly smelled 
	   like pumpkin and cheese pizza, making you hungrier. The fruit felt warm and soft. 
	   Maybe it taste as good as it smells? (eat)
