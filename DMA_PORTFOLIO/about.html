            My name is David Zenteno and I am a Mexican-American 
            student attending San Jose State University. I plan to 
            become a game designer because videogames were a main part
            of my childhood; seeing these unique created worlds, these 
            intricate storylines and characters come to life as if it actually 
            existed, sparked my passion. Itâ€™s imagination coming to life and
            having the ability to share your vision with others. 
            I believe that pursuing Digital Media Art  will help me reach 
            this goal, providing me with vast knowledge. My artwork incorporates 
            a vibrant, colorful palette and hues to bring about the emotions 
            of happiness, comfort, and warmth. What I try to bring in my artwork 
            is a euphoric experience while integrating psychedelic visuals. My 
            interest in dreams and what visuals they produce helps me explore 
            ways to incorporate those traits into my work. I want my art to ease 
            the mind of the viewer and be a therapeutic experience, taking away 
            any stress in the mind. <br>
            Everyone has their special place where they get comfort and peace, 
            and I am recreating that with what I envision. I create my artwork 
            through digital media, using Unity, HTML, CSS, Java, Javascript, 
            Photoshop, Premiere, and Illustrator. Artists like Takashi Murakami 
            and Tyler the Creator influence me to go towards vibrant vivid colors. 
            Game designer Hideo Kojima inspired me to take these works of art and 
            create intricate stories around them. Aesthetics and the human desire 
            for togetherness and tranquility inspire me to create artwork that 
            soothes the soul.
