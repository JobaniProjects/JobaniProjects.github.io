            PRIMATE PARADISE
        </h1>

        <br>

        <p class="text-center">
            During my childhood, one of my go to favorite videogame was Ape Escape 3.
            It was about troublesome monkeys that escaped into the world to cause chaos. 
            The <br> stylish monkeys, the colorful scenes, and the humor of the game is what
            catpured my attention.
            This processing sketch is based on this childhood experience; I wanted <br> to create two monkeys encountering paradise, 
            a temple of bananas. This sketch was difficult at first, because I didn't 
            understand how to use pushMatrix and popMatrix, <br> but after some practice and
            tutorials, I was able to create this sketch by implementing custom functions,
            rotate, translate, arrays, pushMatrix, and popMatrix to make the <br> background bananas
            translate down and spinning, and to create the two monkeys.
