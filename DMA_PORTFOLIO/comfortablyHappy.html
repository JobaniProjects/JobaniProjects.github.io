            Throughout life you will experience many events that impact your life negatively,
            creating a pessamistic mindset. A recent life changing event that has occurred was the
            corona virus pandemic. Life completely changed in an instant, forcing us to adapt at a
            faster rate than usual. Humanity has never been so isolated, due to the quarantine rules
            and regulations. Even though this is occurring, you still find a way to keep going forward.
            Life moves on and so do you. There are many things in life that you cannot control or are
            inevitable. That is what I show in my art piece. The boat and earth exploding represent this.
            Even through all this chaos the person in front still smiles through it all. The sun behind
            represents hope and warmth, clearing away any clouded thoughts. The pandemic has taught me many
            lessons and brought many obstacles too, but it overall made me be appreciative on what I do
            have. Even in the darkest times you can still find inner peace.
            That is what this artwork represents. We can all overcome these confusing times.
