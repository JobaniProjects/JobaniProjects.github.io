             Q1) From the Manovich reading, give 2 examples of user 
             interface with a piece of technology that has a performative
             action or theatrical behavior. This is in context with the 
             ideas credited to Brenda Laurel that Lev mentions in the article.
             They can be electronic/digital or analog but NOT a computer, video
             game console or smart phone. Explain why these are good examples.
                </b>
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 16px;" class="black-text-color"> 
                One example of user interface with performative action would 
                be cameras with an LED display. When you turn on the camera,
                the display would turn on and an animation of the camera's logo
                pops up, and depending on the brand, some also add special effects
                to these welcome startups, demonstrating theatrical behavior. This
                startup is cool, but not necessary. There are cameras that do not 
                have a welcome startup and they go straight to the point and are 
                ready to be used in an instant. Another great example would be
                television. When you turn on the TV, an animation of the brand
                will appear right in the middle of the screen and sometimes a 
                unique startup sound will be heard. This display is not necessary
                because I already know what television brand it is, but it does 
                alert me when someone turns on the TV with its sounds and the 
                startup animation is welcoming and familiar.

                    Q2) Also from the Manovich reading, Lev uses the term Gesamtkunstwerk. What does this term mean and how is he referring to the aestheticization of information tools?
                </b>
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 16px;" class="black-text-color">

                What Lev means when he refers to Gesamtkunstwerk is when
                something engages directly the five senses. Technology can 
                be called Gesamtkunstwerk. This term is referring to the 
                aestheticization of information tools because most of the time
                there are features that capture our attention by 
                engaging our senses and keeps us thinking about the tool. These 
                type of features are not necessary but they do help to 
                distinguish your tool and help captivate the audience to get 
                your tool.

                  Q3) From the RadioLab Podcast, the guest podcast artist
                  is sharing his radio show called 99% invisible. The first
                  piece is about sound design. What would you describe the 
                  role of the sound designer and how does it relate to this 
                  idea of theatre and performance?
              </b>
          </p>

          <p style="font-size: 16px;" class="black-text-color">
              The role of the sound designer is to add sound wherever sound is 
              needed to amplify the mood and energy. It relates to the idea 
              of theatre and performance because sound is used to entertain 
              you and get you attached to the technology. By adding sound it 
              creates a fun environment and experience.

                Q4)From the Skeuomorphism vs. Flat Design article, what 
                are the philosophical and visual differences between 
                Skeuomorphism vs. Flat Design and how might this also relate 
                to this idea of theatre and gamification or aesthetic based 
                event described in the Lev Article?
            </b>
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 16px;" class="black-text-color">
          The difference is that Skeuomorphism tries to replicate designs 
          that are familar to the people to get them comfortable with the 
          product and to easily recognize it. Flat design goes a different route 
          and instead focuses on simple, minimal, and clean design. This relates 
          to the idea of theatre and gamification because the design itself lures 
          your sense of sight and then evokes emotion based on your opinion on the 
          design.

              Q5) Based on the Manovich reading, and following up 
              on Q.1 ., As a group, find some images of 2 or more different
              examples of technologies that embodies for you the authors 
              idea of how interfaces to early electronics or machine systems 
              were designed in the past. Specifically look for examples from 
              1950's,60's, and 70's, (..not 1980's and 90's...). Explain why 
              these are good examples. Then list 2 or more more images of 
              examples of technology that embody the authors ideas of how 
              interfaces are today. Again, explain why these are good examples. 
              Please include images and text description for each example you 
              are refering to. At least 2 images minimum per person from a group. 
              For example a group of 3 should have 6 images. Share these images

        The first image is a 1978 Speak & Spell toy, one of the earliest 
        handheld electronic devices with a visual display and the first to 
        use the first single-chip voice synthesizer. This is a great 
        example because it has theatrical behavior; when starting up the toy, 
        it first plays a playful sound followed by a male robotic voice 
        telling you to spell out a word. Each button you press the robot voice
        will pronounce each time. 
        The second image is a Cozmo bot, a most recent piece of technology that 
        demonstrates characteristics of theatrical behavior. When Cozmo bot is 
        booted up, the display will show two eyeball dots slowly opening and 
        "looking" around its surroundings. Then it starts to speak by making 
        noises that represent and mimic tone and emotion.

            Q6) As a group, please come up with examples of two 
            different kind of technology that normally don't have this 
            interface design or 'consideration' mentioned in the reading 
            and podcast, but could benefit from this 'theatrifaction' or 
            'gamification' idea of its interface. Please describe what would 
            you suggest doing to it to change it.
        </b>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;" class="black-text-color">
        Vending machines could benefit from theatrifaction. When I use a 
        vending machine, it never seems like a great experience using the 
        machine. You insert your money in the machine, pick your drink/snack,
        and the machine gives it to you. There is no connection between the 
        machine and the user. Adding a soft gingle or music like in an 
        elelvator while you pick your beverage/snack will make the experience
        delightful.
