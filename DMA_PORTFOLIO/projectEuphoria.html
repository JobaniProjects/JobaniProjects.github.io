        <p class="text-center ">
            Throughout life we experience emotional pain or trauma and there is 
            nothing else you want to do but get away from the mental agony. You 
            want peace of mind; you <br> want something that  distracts you and brings 
            you happiness. This is the emotion I’m trying to capture, pure 
            ecstasy and tranquility.

            As human beings we strive for <br> protection and safety, 
            and we tend to go towards the light rather than darkness 
            for it, and that’s why I chose these warm colors and sunny
            setting, because nothing <br>sooths the mind better than nature 
            and the summer sun that gives off that yellow orange hue. These 
            colors convey optimism and warmth. Everyone <br> has their special place
            where they get comfort and peace and I am recreating that with
            what I find peaceful.
