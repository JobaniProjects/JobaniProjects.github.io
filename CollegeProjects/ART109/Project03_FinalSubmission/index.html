      <b>Artist Statement</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      I created a small environment that you can easily navigate and explore.
      I wanted to create a planet that is inhabited by one person, so itâ€™s their
      getaway personal planet filled with greenery and a small cabin.
      I wanted to make this environment relaxing, comfortable, and soothing.
      To get this effect, I chose a soft color scheme, made the planet filled
      with plant life, joyful animations, and tranquil sound effects. I was inspired
      to create this mini peaceful planet from a scene of the animated television
      series Dragon Ball Z; experiencing that scene gave me a sense of peace,
      and I recreated this feeling with my project.
