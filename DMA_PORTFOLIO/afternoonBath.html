            AFTERNOON BATH
        </h1>

        <p class="padding-text-statement text-center">
            For this Processing sketch, I wanted to recreate a place of relaxation in my home 
            that helps soothe the mind after a long day. The bathtub was the perfect 
            setting; calming music, bubbles, nice lighting, and the steam coming from 
            the warm water was the environment I wanted to recreate. I used arrays to create 
            the bubbles, steam clouds, and movement in different directions, bouncing
            from wall to wall.
