        <h3>Life and Accomplishments</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Jaime Escalante was born in 1930 in La Paz, Bolivia</li>
          <li>Escalante taught mathematics and physics for 12 years in Bolivia before he immigrated to the United States.</li>
          <li>He worked various jobs while teaching himself English and earning another college degree before eventually returning to the classroom as an educator.</li>
          <li>In 1974, he began to teach at Garfield High School. Escalante eventually changed his mind about returning to work when he found 12 students willing to take an algebra class.</li>
          <li>Shortly after Escalante came to Garfield High School, its accreditation became threatened. Instead of gearing classes to poorly performing students, Escalante offered AP Calculus.</li>
          <li>Determined to change the status quo, Escalante persuaded a few students that they could control their futures with the right education. He promised them that they could get jobs in engineering, electronics, and computers if they would learn math.</li>
          <li>The school administration opposed Escalante frequently during his first few years. He was threatened with dismissal by an assistant principal because he was coming in too early, leaving too late, and failing to get administrative permission to raise funds to pay for his students' Advanced Placement tests.</li>
          <li>Escalante continued to teach at Garfield and instructed his first calculus class in 1978. He recruited fellow teacher Ben Jim√©nez and taught calculus to five students, two of whom passed the AP calculus test.</li>
          <li>The following year, the class size increased to nine students, seven of whom passed the AP calculus test. By 1981, the class had increased to 15 students, 14 of whom passed</li>
          <li> Escalante placed a high priority on pressuring his students to pass their math classes, particularly calculus.</li>
          <li>In 1982, Escalante first gained media attention when 18 of his students passed the Advanced Placement Calculus exam. The Educational Testing Service found the scores to be suspicious because they all made exactly the same math error on the sixth problem, and they also used the same unusual variable names. Fourteen of those who passed were asked to take the exam again. Twelve of them agreed to retake the test, and all did well enough to have their scores reinstated.</li>
          <li>In 1983, the number of students enrolling and passing the calculus test more than doubled. That year, 33 students took the exam, and 30 passed. That year, he also started to teach calculus at East Los Angeles College.</li>
          <li>By 1987, 83 students passed the AB version of the exam, and another 12 passed the BC version. That was the peak for the calculus program</li>
          <li>In 1988, a book, <i>Escalante: The Best Teacher in America</i> by Jay Mathews, and a film, <i>Stand and Deliver</i>, were released based on the events of 1982. Teachers and other interested observers asked to sit in on his classes.</li>
          <li>He shared with them: "The key to my success with youngsters is a very simple and time-honored tradition: hard work for teacher and student alike." </li>
          <li>Escalante received visits from political leaders and celebrities, including President Ronald Reagan and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger.</li>
          <li>In 1990, Escalante worked with the Foundation for Advancements in Science and Education to produce the video series Futures, which won a Peabody Award</li>
          <li>Escalante died on March 30, 2010, at his son's home, while undergoing treatment for bladder cancer. He was 79</li>
        </ul>
