<br>
	<p>
	   For the first assignment, we were given three strategies to choose from: "What 
	   would your closest friend do?", "Decorate, decorate", and "What are the sections,
	   sections of? Imagine a catepillar moving." We all agreed to pick "What would your
	   closest friend do?" as our strategy and we all used paper as our medium.

<br>
	<p>
	   As human beings we strive for protection and safety, and we tend to go towards 
	   the light rather than darkness for it, and thatâ€™s why I chose these warm <br> colors
	   and sunny setting, because nothing sooths the mind better than nature and the 
	   summer sun that gives off that yellow orange hue. <br> These colors convey optimism 
	   and warmth. Everyone has their special place where they get comfort <br> and peace and
	   I am recreating that with what I envision. This is my Art 3 project <br> and I created
	   it with photoshop.

	   Dream Walk (2020)
	</h3>

<br>
	<p>
	   This is my glitch video project from Art 75. I used two videos, one being my favorite 
	   videogames from my childhood, and the other <br> is a pattern video looping. The video
	   was distorted with Touch Designer and the sound was put in with Adobe Premiere Pro.

	<h3>
	   Corrupt Memory (2020)
	</h3>
<br>
	<p>
	   For my Art 74 project the goal was to get an image and distort it enough to 
	   have a glitch effect. I used Photoshop, Notepad++, <br> and Audacity to get this effect
	   and I was trying to capture what a fuzzy memory would look like in the mind of an 
	   android.
