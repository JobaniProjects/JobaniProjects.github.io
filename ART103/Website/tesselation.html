	   For the modification of the petra star I took an individual piece and 
	   inserted it into another piece that had a crevice in it. Then I followed the 
	   <br>
	   same pattern for all the other pieces, flipping some around to have a bit of change
	   on the patter. The result gave me a heart shape. This was 
	   <br>
	   my first attempt and 
	   a happy accident.

	<p>
	   I followed the triangle tesselation tutorial with my own design to get a 
	   wavy tesselation. I found some interesting connections, and I had fun 
	   <br>
	   creating this from start to finish. It was therapeutic.

	   Our group decided to choose the arrows, stars, and circles as our common shape. For our 
	   base shape we chose <br> the square. With these common shapes, it was easier for us to find 
	   parts that would combine with one another. <br> There were no gaps and all our shapes fit 
	   perfectly.

	<p>
	   For my 3D fastener, I wanted the end result to look like a sphere/globe. 
	   I did 1-inch cuts from the tip of the edge where they can <br> interlock with one another.
	   I found this design through a youtube tutorial. The end result was a success. It looks
	   like a lantern <br> near the light.

	   For this trial we decided to use foamboard. There were burns on the foamboard but 
	   overall the pieces were intact. They <br> securely fastened just as planned.

	<p>
	   For my first test in designing my fastener, I decided that the end result look 
	   like a small cubed house. My base <br> shape was squares and one rectangle. The 
	   purpose of the rectangle was to see if it would fasten perfectly to the <br>
	   other shapes.

	<p>
	   Now that I had a better understanding of the fasteners I decided to
	   change my <br> design and make all the pieces fit together to create 
	   a house. 
	   My final design I decided
	   to add details to it. I added flowers and smiley faces <br> on the back.
	   I also added extra square holes to represent windows.

	   These are potential ideas as to where to put the pieces together. <br> This gives

	   2. Building must not topple off in order to count towards your village.  
<br>
	   3. No toppling over other player's buildings.

	<h4>
	   Artist Statement
	</h4>	

	<p>
	   The first idea that our group agreed on was Vanessa's idea of our shapes relating 
	   to houses <br> that are stacked to one another. This idea reminded me of the building 
	   structure of the favelas <br> or certain buildings in Mexico, which also inspired me to
	   create my design to look like a <br> rectangular building. I decided to make my shapes 
	   blue similar to the colorful buildings in <br> Mexico. We were able to achieve our goal 
	   to successfully fasten our pieces together and create <br> a colorful village. 
	</p>

	<h4>
	   My Contribution
	</h4>
	
	<p>
	   Filmed the video <br>
	   Designed 1/4 of the overall pieces <br>
	   Produced the video <br>
	   Edited the video <br>
	   Helped put the pieces together during documentation <br>
	   Did the voice-overs
	</p>

<br>
<br>

	<h4>
	   Improvements and Success
	</h4>
<br>
<br>

	<p>
	   Due to the pandemic rules and regulations, our group's communication was held mostly online,
	   <br> making communication difficult at first, but over time it improved. We all contributed
	   and worked <br> hard on our designs and pieces. All of our pieces connected 
	   with one another and managed <br> to finish the pieces and video documentation on time 
	   despite complications with the laser <br> cutter being unavailable and delaying 
	   our progress. Overall we did our best, we did our part, and <br> our end goal was met.
