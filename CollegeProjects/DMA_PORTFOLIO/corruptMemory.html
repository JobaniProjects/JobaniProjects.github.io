            CORRUPT MEMORY
        </h1>


        <p class="text-center">
            For this piece my goal was to get an image and distort it
            enough to have a glitch effect. I used Photoshop, Notepad++,
            and Audacity to get this effect. I was trying to capture what
            a fuzzy memory would look like in the mind of an android.
