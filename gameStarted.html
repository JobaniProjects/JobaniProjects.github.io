	   <a href="revolverChoice.html">1.</a> The handmade revolver. You created this pistol out of scraps that
	   you found. Lightweight, little recoil, but inferior power. Just hope it doesn't break midfight,
	   because it has a 1.2% chance of breaking at any moment.

	<p>
	   <a href="revolverChoice.html">2.</a> U2 Assult rifle. Good firepower, heavy recoil, and super heavy.
	   It's the ultimate defense, but it also slows you down tremendously.
