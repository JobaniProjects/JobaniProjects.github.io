	<p>
	   Jace is stuck in some alternate dimension bizarro world for nearly 4 years. He never knew how he 
	   got there, but he had hope that he would someday return back to his world,
	   Earth. He recently received information from the locals about a great 
	   Mountain in the East with someone living there at the very top. He was known
	   as the Beast from the East and he could be the key to knowing how to return
	   Jace back home. It was Jace's only lead, but he had hope.
