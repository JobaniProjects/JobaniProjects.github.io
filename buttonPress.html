	   You check around for anyone nearby, but there is nobody in site.
	   You check back at the button and notice that it is the only lit up
	   button. Could this be the way back home? Was it here all along,
	   easily available at anyone's disposal? Or are you getting your hopes up,
	   because its too good to be true. Hesitant, you get your hand closer to the
	   button.
