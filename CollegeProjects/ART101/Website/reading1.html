            <p style="font-size: 16px;" class="black-text-color"> 
                Any kind of artist can use algorithms in their art because
                algorithms are a sequence of commands that get triggered to 
                get an outcome that can be either simple or complex, which 
                allows the artist to go further beyond the capabilities of 
                their art.

                My first artwork example that uses algorithms is a videogame
                group project that is called "Earth Defenders". It used algorithms
                to change scenes, move characters, and tell a story in chronological 
                order. My second example would be a short movie created in one of my 
                classes. The scenes were planned and sketched on a shot sheet, and I 
                recorded the scenes in the same order as the shot sheet. My last example 
                is creating a digital artwork for my final. When creating it, I broke down
                the process into steps. For the first step, I come up with at least 3 
                concepts that I would like the project to be about. Then I pick one 
                that I favor the most, that is possible with the given time, and that is 
                in my skill level. I start creating the artwork and call it my rough draft.
                I work on it again, making edits, calling it my second draft. For the final
                step, I examine it and try to put myself into the perspective of others,
                to determine if it is worthy enough to be turned in. These are the steps
                that took place in order to create the digital artwork for my final. I also 
                use this algorithm on any other digital work that I have done.

                  Q3)  Look at the 6 artists/examples above and please 
                  describe for at least 3 of them, 'where' do you think 
                  the art is and how would you talk about the process of 
                  the 'art' vs the art 'artifact'. For example, If an artist 
                  is using computers to generate art, where is the art? Is it 
                  in the software program or the product it makes? PLease 
                  label each one, then eloborate on the question.

              Harold Cohen and his "other self" called AARON both work together to
              make pieces of art, but Harold working with his code self and creating
              artwork with it is where the art is.

              Miguel Nobrega's outcome of what his 
              code can do is where I think the art is at. There is extreme precision, 
              detail, and quickness when the machine starts to draw, only being 
              possible by the algorithm. Every final outcome will be perfect and cool.

              Turux's ideas of what he wants his tools to do is where the art is. He creates 
              tools that are interactive and unique to his own style. He has created many 
              original tools that never cease to amaze and he has made it simple for other 
              users to use his tools. With a stroke of the mouse you instantly get the 
              max potential of that tool.

              Q5) Given that the Wikihow recipes/instructions are 
              about different subject matter (food, building things, etc)
              Please summerize the differences of all 5 recipes in terms 
              of their style, detail and scope of describing their 
              instructions. How do they describe what the tasks are and 
              why are their styles different?

        The pizza recipe gives a thorough tutorial and goes as far as to tell you
        the other options you have for ingredients. Also, the examples are of real 
        people and not of cartoon. For the tooth brushing instructions, they show the 
        examples in flat design. Also, they give extra pieces of information related to 
        toothbrushing. Rock, paper, scissors, lizards, Spock, explains hand movements
        through a looping video example and the instructions go in depth on the strategy 
        of the game. For the plane instructions, it did not go to hyper detail on the 
        process of making an airplane. It assumes that you know what to do with the 
        information it doesn't provide. The instructions on writing instructions 
        was really detailed. It gave advice to improve and examples that supported its 
        claim.
