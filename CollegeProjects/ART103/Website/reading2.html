	      1)  What are the differences between site specific art work and the idea
	      of art interventions?
	   </b>
	</p>

	<p>
	   Site specific art work is primarily focused on location and it is created to exist in a 
	   specific <br> environment. Art intervention is artwork that focuses on previously existing 
	   art, places, audiences, <br> or circumstances. So site specific has a particular space to 
	   display work while art intervention uses <br> an existing venue.  
	</p>

	   <b>
	      2)  What are the similarities and differences regarding the work of Walter
	      De Maria and Banksy? <br> Include your thoughts on their idea of site specificness
	      and interventions.
	   </b>
	</p>

	<p>
	   Something similar both Banksy and Walter have is that both artists have their
	   art displayed in locations <br> outside of a normal gallery space. Some differences between 
	   them is the way they present their art. <br> Walter's work doesn't stand out as much; it's 
	   simple and almost minimalistic. Banksy places his work in <br> obscure public areas for all
	   to see; it stands out more. This also means that Walter focuses on site-specific <br> art and 
	   Banksy focuses on interventions.

	      3) What are some of the most common creative tactics that all the 'signs'
	      must shares? What must <br> sign have to remain relevant? We are talking about 
	      signs that both in the practical context as well <br> as signs that function
	      as art.
	   </b>
	</p>

	<p>
	   Some of the most common creative tactics that all the signs share would be minimal words,
	   vibrant colors, <br> picture, and bolded letters. It stays relevant because it is very useful
	   for drawing attention to you. It also allows <br> us to communicate a message to one another.

	      4) What kind of art, not shown here, have you seen that was made in
	      response to its location, its <br> environment, a specific event or situation.
	      Please elaborate on its description, provide images if possible.

	   Artist Ervin Loránth Hervé created an impressive sculpture called “Popped Up” 
	   that depicts a giant man <br> crawling out of the earth. It uses the grass that is
	   part of the environment to create that illusion.  This is an <br> example of 
	   site-specific installation.
